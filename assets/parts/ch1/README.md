# SVDOM

App for storing SVG files.

### What will we do?

Develop the simplest server. It that responds only for "/ping" route with text "pong". On other routes it responds with 404 status and "Not Found" text. Also we install all tools that we need for future convinient developing.

### How will we do it?

### What should we do next?

Now we are ready to start using express for creating server. As it is more convinient way to declare our routes and handle json requests.
