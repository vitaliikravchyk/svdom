# SVDOM

App for storing SVG files.

### What will we do?

- Create in-memory database with abilities to add, find, remove and like svg files. It should be able to dump and restore from this dump.
- Create simple server with express.js framework. Declare ping/pong route and learn how to respond with JSON. Declare routes for viewing SVGs. And create CRUD routes to manage SVGs.

### How will we do it?

express:

test routes with postman:

### What should we do next?

Now, when logic is ready, we need to create a view layer for our website.
